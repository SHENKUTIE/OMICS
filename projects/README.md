# All projects

In this course you will complete and independent project analyzing some type of genomic data.
Each week we will give you excercises to analyze your dataset that are related to the topic covered in class.

This dataset can be one related to your research or one you find on NCBI GEO.
You will be in close collaboration with your instructors to ensure the dataset is appropriate.

Each student should create a subdirectory under this directory by their GitHub user-id.
This is where you will keep notes, links, results, figures, etc.
As with the weekly assignments, you will submit PRs as you complete each task.
