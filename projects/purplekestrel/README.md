# Who am I?
Hello world!
**My name is Leanie.**

# My project

I study bacteria which are normally found within the body under healthy conditions. 
Sometimes, these bacteria become pathogenic. It may be the genes in the bacteria, 
some host pressures, the environment, or an interaction between all of these factors.

The name of this bacteria is *Haemophilus influenzae*. It is a gram-negative bacteria. 
It is host restricted, which means it can only survive in a human host. This means it
may have many traits which enable it to survive in its host.
