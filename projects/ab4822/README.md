##INTRODUCTION

Histone modifications play a critical role in regulating gene expression by altering the chromatin structure and accessibility to transcriptional machinery. One such modification, trimethylation of histone H3 on lysine 4 (H3K4me3), is commonly associated with active gene transcription, marking promoters and enhancers of genes involved in various cellular processes.

In the context of HIV infection, immune dysfunction remains a major challenge, with neutrophils—key components of the innate immune system—being significantly affected. Neutrophils contribute to the body's first line of defense against infections, and their dysfunction can lead to impaired immune responses, exacerbating disease progression in HIV-infected individuals. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this dysfunction are not fully understood.

Recent advances in chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) have provided a powerful tool to investigate histone modifications on a genome-wide scale. By examining the distribution of H3K4me3 marks, it is possible to identify genes and regulatory pathways involved in neutrophil function that may be disrupted in HIV-infected individuals.

In this study, "H3K4me3 Histone ChIP-Seq Analysis Reveals Molecular Mechanisms Responsible for Neutrophil Dysfunction in HIV-Infected Individuals," ChIP-seq was employed to uncover the epigenetic alterations associated with neutrophil dysfunction. This analysis offers new insights into the transcriptional regulatory changes driven by HIV infection and highlights potential therapeutic targets for restoring neutrophil function.

The ChIPseq data for the paper was deposited to the GEO, accession number GSE169310.
