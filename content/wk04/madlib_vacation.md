# mAd LiBs VACATIONS

A vacation is when you take a trip to some REPLACE_w_ADJECTIVE place
with your REPLACE_w_ADJECTIVE family. Usually you go to some place
that is near a/an NOUN or up on a/an NOUN.

A good vacation place is one where you can ride REPLACE_w_PLURAL_NOUN
or play GAME or go hunting for REPLACE_w_PLURAL_NOUN.

I like to spend my time REPLACE_w_VERB_ENDING_IN_ING or REPLACE_w_VERB_ENDING_IN_ING.

When parents go on vacation, they spend their time eating
three REPLACE_w_PLURAL_NOUN a day.

Last summer, my little brother fell in a /an NOUN and
got poison PLANT all over his REPLACE_w_PART_OF_BODY.

My family is going to go to (the) REPLACE_w_A_PLACE,
and I will practice REPLACE_w_VERB_ENDING_IN_ING.

Parents need vacations more than kids because parents
are always very REPLACE_w_ADJECTIVE and because they have
to work REPLACE_w_NUMBER hours every day all year
making enough REPLACE_w_PLURAL_NOUN 
to pay for the vacation.
