## Introduction

This week we will continue to learn how to work together in the [**OMICS course**](https://github.com/DamLabResources/OMICS)
using [**GitHub**](https://github.com) and git on the command line in a JupyterHub terminal window.

Millions of people from all over the world build projects together using GitHub.
There are thousands of biochemical projects availble for free as open-source projects 
in areas such as genomics, biochemistry, sequencing, and gene ontology enrichment available on GitHub. 
Major corporations have integrated open-source software into their workflows and products.

You won't want to miss the amazing projects that you can download and use.
This class will begin to show how to interact with these amazing projects.

## Learning Objectives
### git

* Get experience with backing up your work to `origin`

## Project

Set up your OMICS project directory using git and GitHub.

In week 1's [assignment](omics_assignment.md) you will create your own
project directory (`OMICS/projects/yourgitname`) in this OMICS repo and
initialize it with a `README.md`.
